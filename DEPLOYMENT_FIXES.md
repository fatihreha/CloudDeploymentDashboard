# GitHub Actions CI/CD Pipeline Fixes

## Summary
Successfully resolved all GitHub Actions workflow issues and established proper Supabase integration.

## Issues Fixed

### 1. GitHub Actions Syntax Errors
- **Issue**: "Unrecognized named-value: 'secrets'" errors on lines 171, 180
- **Fix**: Changed `secrets.TELEGRAM_BOT_TOKEN` to `env.TELEGRAM_BOT_TOKEN` in if conditions
- **Fix**: Updated curl commands to use environment variables instead of secrets syntax

### 2. Environment Variables Context Access
- **Issue**: "Context access might be invalid" warnings for REGISTRY and IMAGE_NAME
- **Fix**: Added proper environment variable declarations in both `deploy-gcp` and `cleanup` jobs:
  ```yaml
  env:
    REGISTRY: gcr.io
    IMAGE_NAME: cloud-deployment-dashboard
  ```

### 3. Supabase Integration
- **Issue**: Application couldn't connect to Supabase database
- **Fix**: 
  - Created `.env` file with proper Supabase credentials
  - Fixed environment variable name from `SUPABASE_SERVICE_KEY` to `SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY`
  - Added `load_dotenv()` to `app/__init__.py` to ensure environment variables are loaded

### 4. Database Service Configuration
- **Issue**: DatabaseService was looking for wrong environment variable name
- **Fix**: Updated `database_service.py` to use `SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY` instead of `SUPABASE_SERVICE_KEY`

## Files Modified

1. **`.github/workflows/ci-cd.yml`**
   - Fixed secrets syntax in Telegram notification conditions
   - Added REGISTRY and IMAGE_NAME environment variables
   - Corrected curl command variable references

2. **`app/__init__.py`**
   - Added `from dotenv import load_dotenv`
   - Added `load_dotenv()` call in `create_app()` function

3. **`app/services/database_service.py`**
   - Changed `SUPABASE_SERVICE_KEY` to `SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY`

4. **`.env`** (created/updated)
   - Added proper Supabase credentials
   - Configured application environment variables

## Test Results

All CI/CD pipeline steps now pass successfully:
- ✅ Python syntax check
- ✅ App import test  
- ✅ Health endpoint test
- ✅ Supabase connection test

## Supabase Configuration

The application is now properly connected to Supabase with:
- **URL**: https://nlrulnitukuhwdqzirsk.supabase.co
- **Anon Key**: Configured ✅
- **Service Role Key**: Configured ✅

## Next Steps

The CI/CD pipeline is now ready for deployment. The workflow will:
1. Run tests on Python 3.11 and 3.12
2. Perform security scanning
3. Deploy to Google Cloud Platform (when configured)
4. Send Telegram notifications (when configured)
5. Clean up old Docker images

All GitHub Actions workflow errors have been resolved and the application is fully functional with Supabase integration.
